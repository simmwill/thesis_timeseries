### Summary

Using Poisson regression models, we will estimate effects of various
climate exposures on childhood acute nutritional outcomes. We will
consider climate exposures at multiple timescales, including long-term
trends, seasonal patterns, and interannual variation.

### Background

Climate variability has been shown to influence nutrition via several
pathways, including food and financial insecurity, gender-based
disempowerment, health services, and environment (Herforth et al, 2014).
However, research seldom differentiates nutritional vulnerabilities
resulting from climate variation at multiple timescales, e.g. seasonal
patterns versus short-term shocks (Füssel & Klein, 2006). This study
considers such climate-nutrition associations among children in
Bangladesh, a population and country disproportionately at-risk to
climate variability and nutritional shocks (Brouwer et al, 2007;
Stanberry et al, 2018).

   

### Hypothesis

Short-term variation in magnitude and timing of childhood wasting will
be explained by variation in magnitude and timing of regular climate
events.

   

### Data

  - **Nutrition Surveillance Project** (NSP). Bangladesh, 1990-2006. N =
    796996 measurements of child anthropometry, health, and household
    characteristics.
  - **ENACTS** climate data. Bangladesh, 1990-2006. N = 465000+ daily
    precipitation and temperature observations across 22 subdistricts.

   

### Approach

#### *Exposures of interest.*

Our climate-related exposures of interest here come from the ENACTS
dataset detailed above. They include:

  - Daily-level precipitation, in millimeters
  - Daily-level maximum temperature, in degrees Celsius
  - Daily-level minimum temperature, in degrees Celsius

#### *Outcome of interest.*

Our outcome of interest, broadly, is acute nutrition status in children
under age 5. This is operationalized using an anthropometric measure
known as weight-for-length, the ratio of a child’s weight to height (or
length). This measure is standardized into a Z-score using the WHO Child
Growth Standards (World Health Organization, 2006).

#### *Planned analyses.*
