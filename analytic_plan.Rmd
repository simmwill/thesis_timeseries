# **Summary**
Child acute undernutrition (wasting) exhibits clear seasonal patterns in Bangladesh, with the highest prevalence occurring from May to October, approximating the monsoon season. While causes of this phenomenon are still poorly understood, existing research and recent analyses have demonstrated both seasonal and shorter-term links between climate and childhood wasting in Bangladesh. 

## Hypothesis and research questions
We hypothesize that weather and climate patterns play key roles in determining child wasting prevalence in Bangladesh. Specifically, our research investigates the effects on wasting of __within-year__ and __between-year__ (seasonal) variation in weather and climate events.

Broadly, we are interested in answering the following questions:  

  1. __Within year.__ Controlling for observed seasonal patterns and long-term trends in wasting, do weather factors have an effect on childhood wasting? (In other words: can weekly weather factors explain departures in wasting prevalence from the usual seasonal pattern?)
  2. __Between/across years.__ Do anomalies predict the timing and magnitude of specific seasonal wasting patterns seen across years (i.e. the observed 'wasting season' from May to October)?

For both questions, our exposure variables of focus will comprise day- or week-level weather factors: precipitation, maximum temperature, and minimum temperature. Appropriate lag structures will also be explored.

## Analytic methods
For Question 1, we will model time-series patterns in weekly prevalence of childhood wasting by weekly weather patterns, disaggregated across our 25 survey areas. We will use Poisson regression models and include as covariates seasonal and long-term trends in wasting.

Question 2 is a bit more challenging, but we are considering several options:

  1. Use methods similar to Hashizume et al (2010), in which the authors compare the average annual incidence pattern of cholera predicted by each weather factor with an observed average seasonal pattern in cholera.
      * Using this method, we would receive an estimate of how well weather factors predict seasonal cycles in wasting.
  2. If seasonal analyses aggregated across geographic areas appropriate, another option is to build models to predict the timing and magnitude of the seasonal wasting cycle using yearly anomalies in weather factors as predictors. 
      * First, we could judge the appropriateness of geographic aggregation by comparing shorter-term effects across areas during our Question 1 analyses.

# **Details**


## Background
Climate variability has been shown to influence nutrition via several pathways, including food and financial insecurity, gender-based disempowerment, health services, and environment (Herforth et al, 2014). However, research seldom differentiates nutritional vulnerabilities resulting from climate variation at multiple timescales, e.g. seasonal patterns versus short-term shocks (Füssel & Klein, 2006). This study considers such climate-nutrition associations among children in Bangladesh, a population and country disproportionately at-risk to climate variability and nutritional shocks (Brouwer et al, 2007; Stanberry et al, 2018).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Hypotheses  
We hypothesize that abnormal weather and climate will predict changes in observed childhood wasting. Specifically:

(Primary Hypothesis)
We hypothesize that abnormal (< 5th percentile or > 95th percentile for area-specific data) maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and precipitation will be positively associated with prevalence of childhood wasting (acute undernutrition).

(Secondary Hypothesis)
We hypothesize that anomalies in timing and magnitude of regularly-occurring climatic events (e.g. the monsoon season) will be positively associated with shifts in timing and magnitude of childhood wasting (acute undernutrition). 

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Data & Variables
Our climate and nutrition data for these analyses come from two different datasets, with observations matched on date and subdistrict. 

### *Datasets*

  1. **Nutrition Surveillance Project** (NSP). Bangladesh, 1990-2006. N = 796996 measurements of child anthropometry, health, and household characteristics.
  2. **ENACTS** climate data. Bangladesh, 1990-2006. N = 465000+ daily precipitation and temperature observations across 22 subdistricts.

### *Exposures of interest*
Our climate-related exposures of interest here come from the ENACTS dataset detailed above. They include:

  1. Day-level precipitation, in millimeters
  2. Day-level maximum temperature, in degrees Celsius
  3. Day-level minimum temperature, in degrees Celsius
  
### *Outcome of interest*
Our outcome of interest, broadly, is acute nutritional status in children under age 5. This is operationalized using an anthropometric measure known as weight-for-length, the ratio of a child's weight to length (or height). This measure is standardized into a Z-score using the WHO Child Growth Standards (World Health Organization, 2006).

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Analyses

### *1. Within-year (Poisson regression) models*

```{r, echo = FALSE, include = FALSE}

## for these formulas, see latex_formulas.Rmd

```
First, we will model our outcome - daily count of wasting, Y*i* - in univariable time series Poisson regression models, each indcluding our three climate exposures separately. These models will be stratified by subdistrict, across the timespan of our study (1990-2006).

The sub-seasonal timescale at which these time series analyses will be conducted is still to-be-determined, but most likely, the predictors will assume some sort of a week-based lag structure (e.g. a moving average over a 0-8 week lag), and our outcome a weekly count (prevalence) of wasting. This is sensible considering the timescale at which childhood wasting is likely to be modified as an acute measure; however, wasting may be less likely to change significantly within a sub-week time period due to climatic factors. **Further research and references are needed here.**

*Note:* Each of these Poisson regression models will include an offset term, N*i*, which indicates the total sample out of which each daily or weekly wasting count is measured (i.e., the denominator of the wasting proportion/prevalence). Each model will also control for seasonal and long-term trends in wasting in order to predict within-year, sub-seasonal variation. For more information, see section below: [*Note: Filtering out long-term and seasonal patterns in wasting.*](https://github.com/simmwill/thesis_timeseries/blob/master/analytic_plan.md#note-filtering-out-long-term-and-seasonal-patterns-in-wasting)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

![eq1](./images/eq_new_stackbracket.gif)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

These models may be combined into a multivariable Poisson regression model(s), which may also include interaction terms between exposures.

#### Mediational Analyses

As a sub-analysis, we will test diarrheal disease as a potential mediator of each of these relationships by adding a second term to each model:

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

![dia_eq](./images/dia_term.gif)

&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

Since it is a potential mediator, inclusion of diarrheal disease is expected to push each main effect towards the null.

#### Sample weight adjustments

Since our outcome of interest, child weight-for-length Z-score, was sampled using a multistage cluster design, we will explore the use of sampling weights to increase the precision of our inferences. For now, we will focus on the univariable/multivariable and mediational analyses detailed above.

Use of unweighted analyses is currently justified by our belief that there is likely no differential misclassification of exposure or outcome in our sample. Assuming our sample collection was not biased at baseline and representative at the subdistrict level, non-differential misclassification of exposure and/or disease will only bias measures of association towards the null - which, if anything, makes any observed associations more robust.


#### Other considerations for univariable and multivariable within-year models

In these models, we may also choose to operationalize climate exposures as categories determined by percentile levels to aid in interpretation. For example, on days when precipitation was in the upper 25th percentile for a given region, prevalence of wasting was X times the prevalence compared to all other days.

Adjusted models could also be constructed from the above models that consider region- and/or household-level socioeconomic status.

#### Note: Filtering out long-term and seasonal patterns in wasting

Both seasonal (Fig. 1) and long-term (Fig. 2) trends in child wasting have been seen in previous analyses. 

![Alt text](./images/area7_seasonal_notitle.jpg)
*Figure 1: Multiyear average seasonal wasting model, Shakhipur/Sreepur subdistricts*

&nbsp;

![Alt text](./images/weekly_prev_plot.png)
*Figure 2: Downward trend in overall sample prevalence of wasting, 1990-2006*

&nbsp;

These time-dependent patterns are important to consider, especially if we desire a measure of association that is based on variation beyond what is expected within the year and across time. Here, we would like to observe the isolated effects of within-year variation in climate exposures on our outcome of interest, child wasting.

As mentioned above, we can "filter" the effects of seasonal patterns in wasting by including a pre-fitted Fourier curve as a fixed effect in our Poisson regression models. We can also include a linear function of time to capture long-term trends in wasting.

Using our models above, we can undergo a sort of predictive analysis by either:

  1. Comparing a crude Poisson regression model (with the only predictors being the seasonal Fourier term and the linear time function) with our final model including data on precipitation, minimum temperature, and/or maximum temperature;
  2. Extract the residuals from a crude Poisson regression model detailed in #1, and model these residuals using our final model specifications on precipitation, minimum temperature, and/or maximum temperature.
  
Each of these methods would help us to answer the question: Apart from knowing the day of the year (season) and year (long-term trend level), does climate information help us predict childhood wasting? How good is our model above a baseline model including only modelled seasonal and long-term trends?

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

### *2. Between-year (seasonal) models*

Our second set of models - those predicting shifts in timing and magnitude of regularly-occurring wasting patterns - are more preliminary at this point. 

As noted above, we are considering two options currently, but are actively researching this topic:
  1. Use methods similar to Hashizume et al (2010), in which the authors compare the average annual incidence pattern of cholera predicted by each weather factor with an observed average seasonal pattern in cholera.
      * Using this method, we would receive an estimate of how well weather factors predict seasonal cycles in wasting.
  2. If seasonal analyses aggregated across geographic areas appropriate, another option is to build models to predict the timing and magnitude of the seasonal wasting cycle using yearly variation in weather factors as predictors. 
      * First, we could judge the appropriateness of geographic aggregation by comparing shorter-term effects across areas during our Question 1 analyses.

Regardless, we would like as an outcome some indicator of how well fluctuations in timing and magnitude of climate events alters the magnitude and timing of the observed 'wasting season' in Bangladesh. 

Ideally, this would include predictive effect measures useful from a policy perspective. Examples:  
  * For every 1mm increase in peak monsoon rainfall, we expect to see a X% increase in childhood wasting peak during the wasting season.
  * Within two weeks following a heatwave, we expect to see an increase of X% in childhood wasting for every degree of maximum temperature exceeding X degrees.

## Conclusion

With the above analyses, we hope to address the effects of climate exposures on childhood acute malnutrition (wasting) in Bangladesh. Our ultimate goal is to build upon existing relationships with the Government of Bangladesh and local NGOs, continuing to inform nutrition-sensitive climate adaptations and interventions in Bangladesh.
